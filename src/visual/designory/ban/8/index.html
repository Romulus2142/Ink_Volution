                                            KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or the programmed death ligand 1 <br />
                                            (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune- <br />
                                            mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, can affect more than one body system simultaneously, and can
                                            occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed <br />
                                            here may not include all possible severe and fatal<br />
                                            immune-mediated adverse reactions.

                                            mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of <br />
                                            anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and <br />
                                            periodically during treatment. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including <br />
                                            infection. Institute medical management promptly, <br />

                                            Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general, if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic
                                            corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper
                                            over at least 1 month. Consider administration <br />

                                            permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) <br />
