                                            You should not use NEXPLANON if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant; have or have

                                            Talk to your healthcare provider about using NEXPLANON if you have diabetes, high cholesterol or 
                                            triglycerides, headaches, gallbladder or kidney problems, history of depressed mood, high blood

                                            (antiseptics). These medicines will be used when the implant is placed into or removed from your arm.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Immediately after the NEXPLANON implant has been placed, you and your healthcare provider 
                                            should check that the implant is in your arm by feeling for it. If you cannot feel the NEXPLANON 
                                            implant, contact your healthcare provider immediately and use a non-hormonal birth control method 
                                            (such <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">as condoms) until your healthcare provider</span> confirms that the implant is in place.</strong> 
                                            You may need special tests to check that the implant is in place or to help find the implant when 
                                            it is time to take it out.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The implant may not be placed in your arm<br>at all due to failed insertion. If this happens,<br>you may 
                                            become pregnant. Removal of the implant may be very difficult or impossible if the implant is not 
                                            where it should be. Special procedures, including surgery in the hospital, may be needed to remove 
                                            the implant. If the implant is not removed, then the effects of NEXPLANON will continue for a longer 
                                            period of time. Other problems related to insertion and removal include pain, irritation, swelling, 
                                            bruising, numbness and tingling, scarring, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">infection, injury to the nerves or blood vessels,</span> and 
                                            breaking of the implant. Additionally,<br>the implant may come out by itself. You may become pregnant 
                                            if the implant comes out by itself. Use a back up birth control method and call your healthcare 
                                            provider right away if the implant comes out.

                                            <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The most common side effect of NEXPLANON</span> is a change in your normal menstrual bleeding pattern. In 
                                            studies, one out of ten women stopped using the implant because of an unfavorable change in their 
                                            bleeding pattern. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px;">You may experience longer or shorter bleeding</span> during your periods or have no 
                                            bleeding at all. The time between periods may vary, and in between periods you may also have spotting.

                                        <li>
                                            If you become pregnant while using NEXPLANON, you have a slightly higher chance that the pregnancy 
                                            will be ectopic (occurring outside the womb) than do<br>women who do not use birth control. Ectopic 
                                            pregnancies can cause serious internal bleeding, infertility, and even death. Call your healthcare 
                                            provider right away if you think<br>you are pregnant or have unexplained lower stomach (abdominal) pain.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The use of NEXPLANON may also<br>increase your chance of serious blood clots, especially if you have other 
                                            risk factors,<br>such as smoking. If you smoke and want to use NEXPLANON, you should quit. Some examples 
                                            of blood clots are deep vein thrombosis (legs), pulmonary embolism (lungs), retinal thrombosis (eyes), 
                                            stroke (brain), and heart attack (heart). It is possible to die from a problem caused by a blood clot, 
                                            such as a heart attack or stroke. Tell your doctor at least 4 weeks before if you are going to have 
                                            surgery or will need to be on bed rest, because you have an increased chance of getting blood clots 
                                            during surgery or bed rest.
                                        </li>

                                            Cysts may develop on the ovaries and usually go away without treatment, but sometimes surgery is 
                                            needed to remove them.

                                            Besides changes in menstrual bleeding patterns, other common side effects reported in women using 
                                            NEXPLANON include: headaches; vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina); weight gain; acne; breast pain;<br>viral
                                            infection such as sore throats or flu-like symptoms; stomach pain; painful periods; mood swings, 
                                            nervousness, or depressed mood; back pain; nausea; dizziness; pain and pain at the site of insertion. 
                                            Implants have been reported to be found in a blood vessel, including a blood vessel in the lung.

                                            severe chest pain or heaviness in the chest; sudden shortness of breath, sharp chest pain, or

                                            (abdomen); lump in your breast; problems sleeping, lack of energy, tiredness, or you feel very sad; 
                                            heavy menstrual bleeding; or if you feel that the implant may have broken or bent while in your arm.
